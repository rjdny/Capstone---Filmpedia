### Application Overview

Filmpedia is a platform to find all your favorite movies in one place, as well as add them to your favorites, and comment.

My goal was gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, state, and url paramaters.

1. Clone this repository and change to the directory in the terminal.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:heymonicakay/wideRetriever.git
cd wideRetriever
